            <h3>Since working with us, many of our artists have reached thousands more fans – and even topped the charts. </h3>
            <p>As well as being an award winning independent music blog since 2012 we’ve helped several artists take the next steps as independent musicians under A&R Factory’s artist development program – started because we saw so many artists spend so much time releasing music without knowing the right moves to get publicity and plays.<br><br>
              To work with our artist development team, we welcome you to submit your music and profile by filling in the form below and we’ll review each submission personally.</p>
