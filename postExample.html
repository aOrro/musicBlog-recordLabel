            <p>A man of many talents- writing, film and music; ‘Louis the Hippie’ sure likes to keep busy. ’Hen House’’ is a fiery statement single and music video. His flow is unique and he drops those bars hard on this one.<br><br>
              Edited by himself and directed by Greg Francis, I’m a huge fan of this song. It has impact, is raw and is so well shot. The standard of UK Hip Hop has risen so high over the last few years. No longer do US Rappers rule the roost, it’s more like the other way around.<br><br>
              ‘Louis the Hippie’ is up there with the very best in my opinion and he hasn’t even got started yet. I feel like there is a lot more coming and he is building up, ready to raise his level every time he is on the mic.<br><br>

            <p><strong>Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed.</strong><br><br>
