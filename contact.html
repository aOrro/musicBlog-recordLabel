            <p><strong>Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed.</strong><br><br>
             Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the programmer chooses to use them.<br><br>
             In general, these are convenient characteristics; but if these features are not desirable for your particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.</p>
